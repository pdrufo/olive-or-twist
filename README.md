 My Olive or Twist app utilizes theCocktailDB API and helps users find their favorite cocktail. Users can search by ingredients such as vodka, rum or cherry or they can search by a specific drink, like a Mojito.
 Once found, users will see a list of ingredients, instructions on how to make it and the recommended serving glass.
